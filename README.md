## Main Task:
1. Calculate and plot position, velocity, and acceleration trajectories of driving your robot model
from configuration q0 to configuration qf in joint space.
2. Synchronize your 6 joints to start and end motion at the same time.
3. Consider you have controller frequency of 20Hz. Calculate propagated error in end-effector
position.
4. Redefine synchronized trajectories for numerical control.
5. Drive your robot model between 2 consequent points. (Solve polynomial)
6. Solve polynomial constraining null value for initial and final acceleration passing through 4
consequent points.


## Description:
This Assignment consists of main.py file which contains all the tasks (Tasks 1 to 6) as per the problem statement pdf 
(https://github.com/syedjameel/trajectory-planning/blob/trajectory_planning/Home%20Task%203.pdf)



## How to run:
1. clone this branch : https://github.com/syedjameel/trajectory-planning.git
2. go to ~/trajectory_planning folder
3. In terminal run $ python3 main.py


## Testing:
In the main.py file at the end you can see the Tasks 1 to 6, you can just comment or run as it is all the tasks


Thanks for reading me.
